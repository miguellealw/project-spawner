# Project Spawner CLI (still a WIP âš’)

Quickly and easily create static web projects with Project Spawner

## Quick Overview
This CLI comes with three setup options: simple setup, medium setup, and advanced setup
```shell
  ? Choose Setup: (Use arrow keys)
    > Simple Setup    (Includes Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
      Medium Setup    (Includes HTML, CSS / SCSS / SASS, and JavaScript all bundled together with parcel)
      Advanced Setup  (Choose Specificially What You Want)
```
## What each setup offers
**Simple Setup**
* Simple setup with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Great for small projects

**Medium Setup**
* Contains vanilla HTML, CSS / SCSS / SASS and JavaScript
* You are given the option to choose which CSS preprossesor you prefer
* Bundled together with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
  * Parcel transforms the code using [Babel's](https://babeljs.io) `@babel/preset-env` by default, so using the latest JavaScript features is possible. [More Info Here](https://parceljs.org/javascript.html#default-babel-transforms)
  * If you would like to add more Babel presets [read this](https://parceljs.org/javascript.html#babel)
* Great for medium sized projects that require more complex CSS and JavaScript

**Advanced Setup** (Not implemented yet ðŸ˜¢)
